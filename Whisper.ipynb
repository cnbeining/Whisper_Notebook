            "[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  and the winds will have a drastic effect on the airplane and pushing it around.\n",
            "[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  The crew was very familiar with the weather, and they were highly experienced enough to handle anything.\n",
            "[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  We've started our descent. Right now they've reported some moderate turbulence on the descent, so it might get a little choppy.\n",
            "[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  Just watch me the whole way.\n",
            "[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  Yeah, man, you got it.\n",
            "[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  The pilots prepare for the landing.\n",
            "[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  Any comments, just scream out.\n",

            "[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  You know how to land it.\n",
            "[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  They support each other. They back each other up.\n",
            "[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  If anything goes wrong or somebody does something wrong, the other one catches it and corrects it.\n",

            "[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  It's a lot of rain. I can see that.\n",
            "[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  The in-route controllers had told them the weather was going to be bad due to thunderstorms and wind shear.\n",
            "[04:57.000 --> 05:05.000]  Wind shear is a sudden change of wind speed or direction that can be dangerous close to the ground.\n",

            "[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  A non-precision approach means that you don't have a navigation aid.\n",
            "[05:33.000 --> 05:42.000]  There's more reliance on the crew to figure out the altitude and descend those altitudes correctly and avoid all the terrain that's below there.\n",

            "[05:56.000 --> 06:03.000]  The non-precision approach is the hardest of all the approaches to fly because it takes so much attention to fly the approach.\n",
            "[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  It has to be set up correctly.\n",
            "[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  American 1572, be advised.\n",
            "[06:09.000 --> 06:13.000]  The tower is closed at this time due to a problem with one of the windows.\n",
            "[06:13.000 --> 06:19.000]  The non-precision approach and rough weather aren't the only challenges facing the crew.\n",

            "[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  There's a leaky window in the tower.\n",
            "[06:27.000 --> 06:33.000]  At larger airports, the control tower has two areas for managing incoming and outgoing flights.\n",

            "[06:55.000 --> 07:05.000]  But a leaky window has shut down the tower, forcing the air traffic controller to leave her post.\n",
            "[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  The tower controllers are the pilots' eyes on the ground.\n",
            "[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  They're the ones that ensure that the runway is sterile and clear for them to land on, that there are no obstructions, no other traffic.\n",
            "[07:16.000 --> 07:23.000]  They also provide critical information in the late stages of the flight.\n",

            "[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  The pilots were expecting someone to be able to be in the tower, the controller to see the condition of the runway,\n",
            "[07:42.000 --> 07:51.000]  and to give them the information needed to see if anything during the thunderstorm had blown onto the runway so they could make a safe landing.\n",

            "[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  American 1572, looks like you're a bit to the left of final.\n",

            "[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  There is someone in the tower. It's not officially open, but you can change the tower frequency.\n",
            "[08:51.000 --> 09:00.000]  It would have been a big relief to the crew to have someone in the tower, the controller up there, to give them the information they need for the approach.\n",

            "[09:54.000 --> 10:02.000]  Bells and whistles were going off, lights were flashing, and something had to be done.\n",

            "[10:33.000 --> 10:46.000]  They raised the gear, raised the flaps, crammed the engines forward, and immediately after that things went downhill very quickly.\n",
            "[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  Flap motors failed.\n",
            "[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  Five seconds after the pilots commence the go around, the plane's left engine loses power.\n",
            "[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  That's the last thing you need to have happen is a power failure on one of the engines.\n",

            "[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  As the pilots prepare for an emergency landing, the situation worsens.\n",
            "[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  The right engine also fails, turning the MD-83 into a 60-ton glider.\n",
            "[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  They realized they had the second power failure, which made double trouble.\n",

            "[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  But they may not have enough lift to reach it.\n",
            "[11:53.000 --> 12:01.000]  A stall is an aerodynamic effect. It's when the wings lose lift and the airplane loses directional control.\n",
            "[12:01.000 --> 12:10.000]  The only way to fly out of a stall is max power, which they did not have.\n",
            "[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  Hold on, guy.\n",
            "[12:14.000 --> 12:33.000]  Hold it down, alright? Hold it down. Hold it down. Hold it down. Hold it down. Hold it down.\n",
            "[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  God bless you. You made it.\n",
            "[12:43.920 --> 12:47.080]  It was a miracle that the first officer saw the runway and the crew reacted so quickly.\n",
            "[12:47.080 --> 12:52.640]  It was a very good reaction and certainly saved a lot of people's lives.\n",
            "[12:52.640 --> 12:59.640]  Flight 1572 has landed safely after a treacherous final approach.\n",
            "[12:59.640 --> 13:06.640]  Everyone has survived and remarkably only one person has suffered a minor injury.\n",

            "[13:13.640 --> 13:19.640]  One of the key things about something like this is that you never stop flying the airplane.\n",
            "[13:19.640 --> 13:24.640]  And those who do don't live to tell about it.\n",
            "[13:24.640 --> 13:30.640]  The events that nearly brought down Flight 1572 are a complete mystery.\n",
            "[13:30.640 --> 13:33.640]  What have we got so far?\n",
            "[13:33.640 --> 13:40.640]  It will be up to investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, to find the answers.\n",
            "[13:40.640 --> 13:43.640]  Bob Benzon heads up the team.\n",
            "[13:43.640 --> 13:51.640]  I was the investigator in charge with about a dozen NTSB people underneath me, plus many people from the industry.\n",
            "[13:51.640 --> 13:57.640]  The aircraft hit the ground hard approaching the runway threshold.\n",
            "[13:57.640 --> 14:00.640]  Maybe the engines had something to do with it.\n",
            "[14:00.640 --> 14:08.640]  Did a loss of engine power cause Flight 1572 to crash land in front of the runway threshold?\n",
            "[14:08.640 --> 14:16.640]  When we first arrived at the accident site, our first order of business really was to kind of do a reconnaissance look at the aircraft.\n",
            "[14:16.640 --> 14:20.640]  This thing looks like it flew through a war zone.\n",
            "[14:20.640 --> 14:24.640]  During our initial examination, the aircraft was very, very damaged.\n",
            "[14:24.640 --> 14:32.640]  It reminded me of something like a B-17 that had gone through a raid on Schweinfurt in World War II.\n",
            "[14:32.640 --> 14:35.640]  It was beat to heck.\n",
            "[14:35.640 --> 14:42.640]  Branches sticking out of the landing gear, engine blades missing, battered flaps.\n",
            "[14:42.640 --> 14:46.640]  The aircraft was un-flyable.\n",
            "[14:46.640 --> 14:48.640]  They definitely hit some trees.\n",
            "[14:48.640 --> 14:50.640]  Oh, they sure did.\n",
            "[14:50.640 --> 14:54.640]  And the engines definitely had power, and they shredded those branches.\n",
            "[14:54.640 --> 14:59.640]  Mangled branches in the plane's engines indicate that they were working normally.\n",
            "[14:59.640 --> 15:02.640]  The discovery raises another question.\n",
            "[15:02.640 --> 15:11.640]  If the engines had power, why'd they hit the trees?\n",
            "[15:11.640 --> 15:20.640]  The main question became why the aircraft was low enough to hit trees and still make it to the runway.\n",
            "[15:20.640 --> 15:25.640]  If you're going to analyze an accident like this, which is categorized as a controlled flight in terrain,\n",
            "[15:25.640 --> 15:39.640]  you have to understand where the airplane went and when it went there and why it went there.\n",
            "[15:39.640 --> 15:42.640]  Where exactly did they hit the trees?\n",
            "[15:42.640 --> 15:51.640]  To understand why Flight 1572 struck trees, investigators try to identify the first point of impact.\n",
            "[15:51.640 --> 15:56.640]  The trees they hit are on top of a ridge about two and a half miles northwest of the runway.\n",
            "[15:56.640 --> 15:58.640]  We have a team out there now.\n",
            "[15:58.640 --> 16:01.640]  Let's see if the trees or the ridge were marked on the chart.\n",
            "[16:01.640 --> 16:08.640]  The approach chart itself, when you look at it, had the ridge marked with a small dot with the altitude.\n",
            "[16:08.640 --> 16:13.640]  The chart has the top of the ridge at 819 feet.\n",
            "[16:13.640 --> 16:17.640]  Once we began to look at the approach chart itself that the crew was using,\n",
            "[16:17.640 --> 16:24.640]  we noted that the ridge line was just a mere dot with the number 819 next to it and altitude.\n",
            "[16:24.640 --> 16:26.640]  That dot could have been anything.\n",
            "[16:26.640 --> 16:28.640]  It could have been a building, a giant tree.\n",
            "[16:28.640 --> 16:34.640]  Other airlines use a slightly different chart that shows topographical features, including this ridge line.\n",
            "[16:34.640 --> 16:42.640]  Why did Flight 1572 come in too low? Because there was a lack of detail on their approach chart.\n",
            "[16:42.640 --> 16:45.640]  Do we have an altitude for the tree strike?\n",
            "[16:45.640 --> 16:56.640]  I need an altitude for the first impact mark.\n",
            "[16:56.640 --> 16:59.640]  771 feet.\n",

            "[24:43.640 --> 24:46.640]  It was a good initiative for him to do that.\n",
            "[24:46.640 --> 24:52.640]  It's something that some people would not have done based on the fact that the tower itself was a bit of a precarious area.\n",

            "[25:16.640 --> 25:22.640]  As they neared the ground, the crew decided to make their final descent at a thousand feet per minute.\n",
            "[25:22.640 --> 25:25.640]  Nearly double what is normal.\n",
            "[25:28.640 --> 25:33.640]  That in my mind is quite excessive. You didn't have to descend that steeply.\n",
            "[25:33.640 --> 25:38.640]  Especially on a non-precision approach where you have a minimum descent altitude that you should not be going below.\n",
            "[25:38.640 --> 25:48.640]  The faster you're descending, the earlier you have to start leveling off or else you end up going below the target altitude by the time you correct and come back up again.\n",
            "[25:48.640 --> 25:54.640]  According to the descent profile, they're five miles from the airport at 1900 feet.\n",

            "[26:10.640 --> 26:14.640]  Sure, that's fast, but the first officer should be calling out the altitudes.\n",
            "[26:14.640 --> 26:20.640]  While the aircraft is descending, the pilot is supposed to monitor the airplane's MDA, the MDA altitude.\n",
            "[26:20.640 --> 26:29.640]  The first officer should call a thousand above the MDA to the captain and then 100 foot to the MDA and then the MDA altitude.\n",
            "[26:29.640 --> 26:38.640]  Okay, let's listen to the first officer's call outs.\n",
            "[26:38.640 --> 26:39.640]  There's a thousand feet.\n",
            "[26:39.640 --> 26:43.640]  Good, he made a thousand foot call out.\n",
            "[26:43.640 --> 26:48.640]  But they don't hear any more call outs after that.\n",
            "[26:48.640 --> 26:56.640]  The first officer called out the thousand foot above the MDA. He did not call out the hundred foot above the MDA.\n",
            "[26:56.640 --> 27:02.640]  Investigators then hear something unusual.\n",
            "[27:02.640 --> 27:04.640]  A thousand and eighty is your, uh...\n",
            "[27:04.640 --> 27:07.640]  Right.\n",

            "[27:15.640 --> 27:17.640]  Hang on.\n",
            "[27:17.640 --> 27:19.640]  Was that the minimum descent altitude call out?\n",
            "[27:19.640 --> 27:22.640]  I think it was supposed to be.\n",
            "[27:22.640 --> 27:28.640]  The team discovers that the first officer mishandled the remaining call outs.\n",
            "[27:28.640 --> 27:34.640]  The first officer started to call out for the MDA but never finished his sentence.\n",
            "[27:34.640 --> 27:37.640]  So he makes half a call at their minimums.\n",
            "[27:37.640 --> 27:41.640]  And then doesn't say anything else until they're below it.\n",
            "[27:41.640 --> 27:44.640]  And by then they've hit the trees.\n",
            "[27:44.640 --> 27:50.640]  Why did the pilots make such a critical error so close to landing?\n",
            "[27:50.640 --> 27:53.640]  Let's talk to the pilots.\n",
            "[27:53.640 --> 27:57.640]  In this particular case we were very fortunate to have a live crew to interview.\n",
            "[27:57.640 --> 28:06.640]  We wanted to determine exactly what they were thinking about during the accident.\n",
            "[28:06.640 --> 28:07.640]  Walk me through your actions.\n",
            "[28:07.640 --> 28:11.640]  Four miles from the airport as you approached minimum descent altitude.\n",
            "[28:11.640 --> 28:21.640]  Look, the weather was rough. We were two hours late departing. I was monitoring the instruments.\n",
            "[28:21.640 --> 28:27.640]  A thousand and eighty is your, uh, right.\n",
            "[28:27.640 --> 28:29.640]  Okay. And then what?\n",
            "[28:29.640 --> 28:34.640]  As we got closer to the minimum descent altitude...\n",
            "[28:34.640 --> 28:38.640]  I looked outside for the airport.\n",
            "[28:38.640 --> 28:44.640]  And when I looked back we were below minimums.\n",
            "[28:44.640 --> 28:48.640]  You're going below your...\n",
            "[28:48.640 --> 28:54.640]  During that time he was looking out. He was not monitoring the flight gauges as closely as he should have been.\n",
            "[28:54.640 --> 29:07.640]  In this case the appropriate procedure would have had the first officer glued to the altimeter and the compass and other instruments in the cockpit until the captain said, I see the runway.\n",
            "[29:07.640 --> 29:09.640]  Why didn't you call for a go around?\n",
            "[29:09.640 --> 29:14.640]  Well there was no time. We immediately hit the trees.\n",
            "[29:14.640 --> 29:19.640]  What the...\n",
            "[29:19.640 --> 29:23.640]  It was a stressful night.\n",
            "[29:23.640 --> 29:36.640]  There could be a bit of task saturation in there. This went from an easy kind of relaxed flight with a little bit of weather difficulty to, oh my gosh, everything's going wrong really, really fast.\n",
            "[29:36.640 --> 29:44.640]  Something doesn't add up. The first officer couldn't have been at his minimum seconds before hitting the trees.\n",
            "[29:44.640 --> 29:49.640]  Maybe there was an issue with the altimeter settings.\n",
            "[29:49.640 --> 29:57.640]  Pilots must calibrate the altimeters based on outside air pressure, which can change dramatically in extreme weather conditions.\n",
            "[29:57.640 --> 30:04.640]  Pilots frequently recalibrate the altimeters to maintain an accurate altitude reading.\n",
            "[30:04.640 --> 30:09.640]  Altimeter setting is very important. You can't do an approach in bad weather unless you know what the altitude of your airplane is.\n",
            "[30:09.640 --> 30:17.640]  Let's see what settings they used.\n",
            "[30:17.640 --> 30:20.640]  It's a lot of rain. I can see that.\n",
            "[30:20.640 --> 30:28.640]  In this case, because of the storm that was going through that area, the pressure was falling rapidly. And when that happens, your altimeter setting goes down quickly.\n",
            "[30:28.640 --> 30:39.640]  It means if you don't reset your altitude, then your airplane is flying lower than you think it is.\n",
            "[30:39.640 --> 30:46.640]  Here. The dispatcher updated them with an altimeter setting of 29.23.\n",
            "[30:46.640 --> 30:57.640]  NTSB investigators check whether the pilots of American Airlines Flight 1572 properly set the altimeter during the stormy approach into Bradley Airport.\n",
            "[30:57.640 --> 31:03.640]  What time was that? 12.30 a.m.\n",
            "[31:03.640 --> 31:06.640]  That was 25 minutes before they hit the trees.\n",
            "[31:06.640 --> 31:12.640]  And with changing weather conditions, they must have received an update from Bradley ATC.\n",
            "[31:12.640 --> 31:24.640]  One thing that the crew considers and expects from the tower, our air traffic, is the update of the weather as quick as possible, so they can also amend what they need to do.\n",
            "[31:24.640 --> 31:29.640]  Okay. They first contacted approach control at 12.43.\n",

            "[32:06.640 --> 32:12.640]  Approach did not update their altimeter setting, even though the pressure was dropping rapidly.\n",
            "[32:12.640 --> 32:18.640]  There's nothing at all from approach right up until he passes them off to the tower.\n",
            "[32:18.640 --> 32:21.640]  Why wouldn't the approach controller give them a weather update?\n",
            "[32:21.640 --> 32:25.640]  Good question. Let's ask them.\n",
            "[32:25.640 --> 32:35.640]  One thing that puzzled investigators was why the air traffic controllers in the Bradley tower didn't keep the pilots updated with a current altimeter setting.\n",
            "[32:35.640 --> 32:38.640]  You mentioned before that the weather was quite active that night.\n",
            "[32:38.640 --> 32:40.640]  Yes. It was changing quickly all night.\n",
            "[32:40.640 --> 32:44.640]  What was the airport's altimeter setting at the time of the accident?\n",
            "[32:44.640 --> 32:50.640]  Let me see. 29.15.\n",
            "[32:50.640 --> 32:58.640]  Investigators learned that the altimeter pressure setting at the time of the accident was not the setting the pilots were originally given.\n",
            "[32:58.640 --> 33:02.640]  Why didn't the crew receive an updated setting?\n",
            "[33:02.640 --> 33:13.640]  29.15.\n",
            "[33:13.640 --> 33:19.640]  I didn't think to give it to them.\n",
            "[33:19.640 --> 33:31.640]  Sometimes things that you do over and over and over again become too routine and late at night when there's not a whole lot going on.\n",
            "[33:31.640 --> 33:34.640]  Sometimes those are the things that drop through the cracks.\n",
            "[33:34.640 --> 33:39.640]  We warned them about that excuse a little bit, but it's what he said.\n",
            "[33:39.640 --> 33:46.640]  So in essence, the pilots did not have the current altimeter setting when they flew the approach.\n",
            "[33:46.640 --> 33:50.640]  We got the altimeter setting from the time of the accident.\n",
            "[33:50.640 --> 33:58.640]  Comparing the two altimeter settings will reveal how much lower the plane was flying than it should have been.\n",
            "[33:58.640 --> 34:01.640]  0.08.\n",
            "[34:01.640 --> 34:11.640]  The difference in the altimeter setting from what they had put on their instruments to what was in reality was about 0.08 inches of mercury, which equates to 76 feet.\n",
            "[34:11.640 --> 34:18.640]  Because of the pilots' updated setting, they thought they were 76 feet higher than they actually were.\n",
            "[34:18.640 --> 34:21.640]  The discovery is eye-opening.\n",
            "[34:21.640 --> 34:25.640]  Once you get close to the ground, 76 feet is a big deal.\n",
            "[34:25.640 --> 34:32.640]  You're coming across the minimum descent altitude and you're keeping the airplane level at the minimum descent altitude, 76 feet is critical.\n",
            "[34:32.640 --> 34:37.640]  The question is, would they have hit anything had they been 76 feet higher?\n",
            "[34:37.640 --> 34:44.640]  Well, we know they struck the trees at an altitude of 771 feet. Add 76 feet to that.\n",
            "[34:44.640 --> 34:46.640]  They wouldn't have hit anything?\n",
            "[34:46.640 --> 34:47.640]  No impact.\n",
            "[34:47.640 --> 34:56.640]  If they had the correct altimeter setting, even though they went below the MDA, they still would have been 76 feet higher.\n",
            "[34:56.640 --> 35:01.640]  And we probably wouldn't be talking about this right now because they would have missed the trees.\n",
            "[35:01.640 --> 35:07.640]  But that doesn't explain why they were 309 feet below their minimum descent altitude.\n",
            "[35:07.640 --> 35:13.640]  76 feet of that are on ATC. The other 233 feet are pilot error.\n",
            "[35:13.640 --> 35:22.640]  This was out of the control of the pilots to a certain extent, but going below the MDA should have been caught by both the first officer and the captain.\n",
            "[35:22.640 --> 35:25.640]  This is what created the accident.\n",
            "[35:31.640 --> 35:34.640]  In the end, it came down to the crew's decision.\n",
            "[35:34.640 --> 35:39.640]  Investigators now understand what happened to Flight 1572.\n",
            "[35:39.640 --> 35:45.640]  The outdated altimeter setting and the rough weather meant that the crew had almost no room for error on the approach.\n",
            "[35:45.640 --> 35:52.640]  And when they were descending too fast and past their minimum descent altitude, there was no way they could have recovered before hitting the trees.\n",
            "[35:53.640 --> 35:57.640]  Only one question remains unanswered.\n",
            "[35:57.640 --> 36:09.640]  In spite of hitting the trees, how did they make that landing?\n",
            "[36:09.640 --> 36:13.640]  Here's the FDR readout.\n",
            "[36:13.640 --> 36:25.640]  NTSB investigators turn to Flight 1572's flight data recorder to learn how the crew managed to recover their jet after they struck the trees.\n",
            "[36:25.640 --> 36:34.640]  So, they hit the trees and they immediately pull the flaps back to 15 and go to max thrust.\n",
            "[36:34.640 --> 36:39.640]  The data shows that the crew quickly configured the plane for a go around.\n",
            "[36:39.640 --> 36:42.640]  Go, go around. Go on around.\n",
            "[36:47.640 --> 36:51.640]  Flaps 15, positive rate, gear up.\n",
            "[36:51.640 --> 36:54.640]  Gear up.\n",
            "[36:54.640 --> 37:00.640]  Then, just as they begin their go around, they lose their left engine.\n",
            "[37:04.640 --> 37:12.640]  The aircraft actually ingested trees, the tops of the trees, into the engines.\n",
            "[37:12.640 --> 37:15.640]  Left motor's failed.\n",
            "[37:15.640 --> 37:18.640]  Followed by their right engine.\n",
            "[37:18.640 --> 37:25.640]  Here you have a scenario where something devastating just happened.\n",
            "[37:25.640 --> 37:32.640]  We just plowed through some trees on the top of a ridge two and a half miles away from the runway and losing capabilities on this aircraft by the second.\n",
            "[37:32.640 --> 37:37.640]  They've got the nose way up, they're losing speed, and both their engines are gone.\n",
            "[37:37.640 --> 37:40.640]  That's a recipe for a stall if I've ever seen one.\n",
            "[37:40.640 --> 37:43.640]  All of a sudden, they were starting to lose airspeed.\n",
            "[37:43.640 --> 37:48.640]  They were in a nose high attitude and that's the worst time that can happen.\n",
            "[37:48.640 --> 37:50.640]  Airspeed is what makes the airplane fly.\n",
            "[37:50.640 --> 37:54.640]  If there isn't enough air moving over the wings, the wings stop flying.\n",
            "[37:54.640 --> 37:57.640]  And that is what's referred to as a stall.\n",
            "[37:57.640 --> 38:00.640]  There's the runway, straight ahead.\n",
            "[38:00.640 --> 38:03.640]  Fortunately, the first officer saw the runway.\n",
            "[38:03.640 --> 38:09.640]  They had to get the airplane on the ground in a hurry because they would not be able to keep on flying with the engine power they had.\n",
            "[38:09.640 --> 38:12.640]  Okay, tell them we're going down. Tell them emergency.\n",
            "[38:12.640 --> 38:15.640]  So now he's got to reconfigure the aircraft again.\n",
            "[38:15.640 --> 38:17.640]  And remember, this is all happening in seconds.\n",
            "[38:17.640 --> 38:25.640]  He's got to focus on trying to save whatever altitude and airspeed he has left to make it across the fence into the runway environment.\n",
            "[38:25.640 --> 38:29.640]  This is a critical stage of flight now because he doesn't have power.\n",
            "[38:29.640 --> 38:31.640]  All he can do is trade altitude for airspeed.\n",
            "[38:31.640 --> 38:35.640]  Now we know they're flaps. We're all the way down at 40.\n",
            "[38:35.640 --> 38:39.640]  Flaps 40. All the way down. They're all the way down.\n",
            "[38:39.640 --> 38:43.640]  He's going to generate something else that's going to get him across the fence.\n",
            "[38:43.640 --> 38:46.640]  And that's when he drops 40-degree flaps.\n",
            "[38:46.640 --> 38:51.640]  The drag from the flaps slows them down, but for the first few seconds it balloons them up.\n",
            "[38:51.640 --> 38:57.640]  40 degrees of flaps change the curve of the wing, which increases the lift of the wing,\n",
            "[38:57.640 --> 39:03.640]  and gives him that extra little bounce to get a little bit further.\n",
            "[39:03.640 --> 39:07.640]  If he had not have done that or if he would have delayed it a little bit,\n",
            "[39:07.640 --> 39:11.640]  the accident could have been totally catastrophic.\n",
            "[39:11.640 --> 39:15.640]  You got it, dude. You're going to make it.\n",
            "[39:15.640 --> 39:18.640]  They glide down to the runway.\n",
            "[39:18.640 --> 39:23.640]  Unfortunately, they didn't have quite enough airspeed in altitude, so they landed early,\n",
            "[39:23.640 --> 39:34.640]  kind of scooted and flopped onto the pavement of the runway.\n",
            "[39:34.640 --> 39:43.640]  They had mistakes going into the tree strike, if you will, and yet did a brilliant job landing the aircraft.\n",
            "[39:43.640 --> 39:52.640]  That's an incredible show of airmanship.\n",
            "[39:52.640 --> 39:58.640]  The crews actually excellent cockpit resource management in the very difficult situation that occurred\n",
            "[39:58.640 --> 40:00.640]  after they hit the ridgeline.\n",
            "[40:00.640 --> 40:04.640]  They cooperated. They didn't panic.\n",
            "[40:04.640 --> 40:08.640]  The way these two pilots worked together was remarkable,\n",
            "[40:08.640 --> 40:13.640]  and one of the last things that's on the tape that kind of really gives you a chill is after they make the runway.\n",
            "[40:13.640 --> 40:20.640]  The first officer says, God bless you. You made it.\n",
            "[40:20.640 --> 40:24.640]  This is an accident that probably is not well known to a lot of people,\n",
            "[40:24.640 --> 40:32.640]  and that's because the aircraft was able to end up on a runway and nobody was killed.\n",
            "[40:32.640 --> 40:37.640]  The captain's impressive recovery doesn't make up for the crew's errors.\n",
            "[40:37.640 --> 40:42.640]  The NTSB's final report concludes that the probable cause of this accident was the crew\n",
            "[40:42.640 --> 40:49.640]  flying below the minimum descent altitude before they could see the runway.\n",
            "[40:49.640 --> 40:56.640]  We think, in essence, the main factor involved in the accident was the fact that the pilots did not monitor\n",
            "[40:56.640 --> 41:00.640]  the altitudes they were flying through correctly.\n",
            "[41:00.640 --> 41:04.640]  They should have leveled off at a point, and they simply did not do so.\n",
            "[41:04.640 --> 41:10.640]  Following the accident, American Airlines increased the MDA requirement by 100 feet\n",
            "[41:10.640 --> 41:16.640]  and visibility requirement by half a mile for non-precision approaches to Bradley Airport.\n",
            "[41:16.640 --> 41:19.640]  That's a lot of rain.\n",
            "[41:19.640 --> 41:24.640]  The NTSB also recommends that in conditions where pressure is falling rapidly,\n",
            "[41:24.640 --> 41:29.640]  controllers should issue altimeter setting updates as frequently as possible.\n",
            "[41:29.640 --> 41:32.640]  The approach controller issues the current altimeter setting.\n",
            "[41:32.640 --> 41:38.640]  That didn't happen either. What's important to understand, though, in terms of responsibility,\n",
            "[41:38.640 --> 41:42.640]  is that the captain is the final authority on the flight.\n",
            "[41:42.640 --> 41:46.640]  It's ultimately the captain's responsibility to ensure the safety of the flight.\n",
            "[41:46.640 --> 41:51.640]  In this case, he did not ensure that he had the most current altimeter setting.\n",
            "[41:51.640 --> 41:58.640]  This accident was important to me because it was one of the few where nobody was killed,\n",
            "[41:58.640 --> 42:03.640]  nobody was hurt, and yet the safety board came up with some pretty good recommendations\n",
            "[42:03.640 --> 42:13.640]  to mitigate some of the factors that existed.\n"
